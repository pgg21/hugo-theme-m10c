# Introduction

A fork of [vaga's](https://github.com/vaga) theme [m10c](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-m10c/) for [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The initial intention of this fork was to add useful partials that are not present in the upstream repo â€” e.g. collapsible lists. No attempt will be made to merge these changes back to upstream, since the upstream is explicitly intended to be a minimalistic theme, and I doubt the changes I make here will be useful to anyone but myself.

## Getting started

### Installation

Create a new Hugo site:

$ hugo new site [path]
```

Clone this repository into `themes/` directory:
```bash
$ cd [path]
$ git clone https://github.com/pgg21/hugo-theme-m10c.git themes/m10c
```

Add this line  in the `config.toml` file:
```toml
theme = "m10c"
```

### Configuration

In your `config.toml` file, define the following variables in `params`:

- `author`: Name of the author
- `description`: Short description of the author
- `avatar`: Path of file containing the author avatar image
- `menu_item_separator`: Separator between each menu item. HTML allowed (default: " - ")
- `favicon`: Absolute path of your favicon.ico file (default: "/favicon.ico")

To add a menu item, add the following lines in `menu`:

```
[[menu.main]]
  identifier = "tags"
  name = "Tags"
  url = "/tags/"
```

[Read Hugo documentations](https://gohugo.io/content-management/menus/#readout) for more informations about menu

To add a social link, add the following lines in `params`:

```
[[params.social]]
  icon = "github"
  name = "My Github"
  url = "https://github.com/pgg21"
```

To change theme colors, add the following lines in `params`:

```
[params.style]
  darkestColor = "#d35050"
  darkColor = "#212121"
  lightColor = "#f5e3e0"
  lightestColor = "#f5f5f5"
  primaryColor = "#ffffff"
```

If you want the above theme colors, you can see the [exampleSite/config.toml](/exampleSite/config.toml) file.

### Styling

To override styles using scss, add a file called `_extra.scss` to `[path]/assets/css/`

**Note:** Hugo releases come in two versions, `hugo` and `hugo_extended`. You need `hugo_extended` to automatically compile your scss.
